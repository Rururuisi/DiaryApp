# DiaryApp

In order to get familiar with React.js and Material UI, I made this MERN diary web app for my friend. </br>

**The UI interface is designed by imitating the mobile app.** </br>
**For PC access:** Reduce the width of the web page can get a better view effect. </br></br>

I will continuously develop the UI for PC-appropriate in the future. 

**Account Tab is incomplete** for now and will be continued to develop on my spare time. </br></br>

Steps for Running the Project: 
1. run `yarn install` to install the dependency
2. run `npm run start` to concurrently run the server and client

(The server is ran on localhost:5000, and the client is ran on localhost:3000)
